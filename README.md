This application allows the user to find the longest word in the English language given certain parameters. On the front end, the user will have certain pre-set parameters they can select (no vowels, no consonants, left-hand keyboard, right-hand keyboard, etc), but can also enter their own parameters and run the app.

The inspiration for this application came from Tom Scott's video [What's The Longest Word You Can Write With Seven-Segment Displays?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4BMR88260). And uses [dwyl's](https://github.com/dwyl) list of [English words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).
